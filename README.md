## Usage Example
It will generate 1 random point for each plot, and it is going to determine the class which belongs to. The dataset is a random dataset with the only purpose to see the algorithm behavior. The dataset is declared in test.py, and you are open to change any part of the whole code to adapted for your requirements.
```bash
python3 main.py
```
### Running an Example 
```bash
python3 main.py --example [example folder name from examples directory]
```
```bash
python3 main.py -e flowers
```
